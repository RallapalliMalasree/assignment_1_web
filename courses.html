            <h3><strong>Seminar in database management system</strong></h3>
            <p>This course discusses blockchain security with an emphasis on creating and auditing smart contracts. We will study assault scenario analysis and smart contract open-source code. We will be able to comprehend a wide range of block technology principles and carry out basic smart contract programming and audit in cutting-edge settings and tools.</p>
            <h3><strong>Computer Graphics</strong></h3>
            <p>The field of computer graphics focuses on using technology to create works of art and pictures. Computer graphics are a fundamental technology used in many specialized applications today, including digital photography, movies, video games, digital art, mobile phone and computer displays.
            User interface development, sprite graphics, rendering, ray tracing, geometry processing, computer animation, vector graphics, 3D modeling, shaders, GPU design, implicit surfaces, visualization, scientific computing, image processing, computational photography, scientific visualization, computational geometry, and computer vision are some of the topics in computer graphics. The underlying sciences of geometry, optics, physics, and perception play a significant role in the whole technique.</p>
            <h3><strong>Principal of Web Technology</strong></h3>
            <p>Web technology refers to the numerous methods and instruments used in the transmission of data between different kinds of devices via the internet. To access websites, one must utilize a web browser. Web browsers are software applications that show text, data, images, animations, and videos on the Internet. With the software interfaces offered by Web browsers, users can access hyperlinked resources on the World Wide Web.</p>
            <h3>Seminar in database managment system Project</h3>
            <p>In this we are going to implement a smart contract by injecting the "Unstoppable" vulnerability into PPSwap contract.In this vulnerability,
               thereâ€™s a tokenized vault that contains one million DVT tokens. It is offering flash loans for free (without any fees) for a limited time. In order to attack the contract,
               we have stopped the vault from offering flash loans.
            <h3>Principles of webtechnology Project</h3>
            <p>In the past farmers vsiting the bank and applying for the insurance is the time taking process.Hence,We have developed an idea of creating a web application for farmers to register their crops and the poultry to claim their insurance in easy manner.</p>
